# assignment-b1-and-b2-Qinhuai_Xu

**This is the project for STAT 545B assignment B-1 & B-2**

In this assignment, I made a function called `Mode`, including 4 parts:
* Implementation
* Document
* Example
* Test


This function will accept list input and return the mode(most appearing) number/character in it.
